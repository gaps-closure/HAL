# Example 

This example is produced for NGC to demonstrate how to write
directly to HAL in c++, rather than using `libxdcomms`.  

## Assumptions
ZeroMQ 3 must be installed as well as (zmqpp)[https://github.com/zeromq/zmqpp].

On Ubuntu 20.04, this can be installed as follows:

```
sudo apt install libzmq3-dev libzmqpp-dev
```
