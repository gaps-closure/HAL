This directory contains (de-)serialization codecs for cross-domain datatypes, DFDL descriptions of the bianry formats shared over cross-domain GAPS devices, and other provisioning-time GAPS device configuration files that are derived from each cross-domain application.

Currently these are generated by the developer, but eventually these will be auto-generated by the CLOSURE CAPO tools.
