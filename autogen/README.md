# Autogeneration Utilities

This directory holds utilities for automatic generation of serialization codecs
for use with the HAL C API, DFDL files describing the on-wire data formats of
application data within GAPS PDUs,  DAGR files for provisioning guard rules,
HAL configuration files, and possibly other artificats needed to provision 
the guard hardware.  

Initially, we will focus on autogeneration of codecs and DFDL, other capabilities 
will be added later.

The input files for the autogeneration include: 
  1. Interface Definition Language (IDL) files of the cross-domain datatypes
  2. Security policy derived from CLE annotations 

These inputs can be generated by the CLOSURE tools (MULES and CAPO), or provided by the developer.


## Interface DEfinition Language Syntax

The IDL syntax is based on C; an IDL file contains one or more C struct datatypes. 

Datatype tags are assigned numerically in the order the structs are found in the file.
Not all valid C struct declarations are supported.

Currently we support the following atomic types: char, unsigned char, short,
unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, float, double. We also
support fixed-size arrays of any supported atomic type.

Additionally we plan to support null-terminated C-strings.  We might also
include std::array and std::vector of the supported atomic types, std::string.
